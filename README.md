Hi, I’m @Samuelchazy.
Being a data scientist myself I take deep dives into the data world to uncover patterns that others can’t see. By building machine learning models and deep neural network models, I analyze information in the data to predict future probabilities. I assist companies in improving their efficiency and performance in the domain of sales and marketing.

With a post-graduate diploma in Data Science from Emeritus, and a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the International University of Applied Sciences in Germany, I have acquired a deep knowledge of the data world and how it solves business challenges in the various industries.
